# On-chain Analysis: Whale Scanner in TON

An online application for on-chain analysis aimed at identifying large cryptocurrency holders (whales) in the TON blockchain. The application offers a scanner that allows users to obtain information about the largest wallets in TON, effectively analyzing their assets and behavior.

## üìå Key Features

- Whale Detection in TON: The application enables the identification of addresses with high balances using analytical algorithms to determine major token holders.
- Wallet Profiles: The ability to view information about wallets, including balance and transaction history.
- Filtering and Ranking: Wallet profiles are sorted by similarity to specified criteria to showcase the most relevant addresses.
  
## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Requirements

- Frontend: Angular for creating a user-friendly interface.
- Backend: FastAPI for handling requests and all application logic.
- Analytics: Using Python along with libraries for data analysis.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   
   
   git clone https://github.com/yourrepository.git
   cd yourrepository
   
   
2. Install dependencies:
   - For the frontend:
     
   
   cd front-end
   npm install
   
     
   - For the backend:
     
   
   cd back-end
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
     
3. Configure environment variables: Ensure that your environment variables are correctly set up to connect to FastAPI.

4. Run the application:
   - For the frontend:
     
   
   ng serve
   
     
   - For the backend:
     
   
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   
     
5. Open the application in the browser: Navigate to http://localhost:4200 to access the user interface.

## üõ† Development Process

1. Research TON: Explore the features of the TON blockchain to effectively gather and analyze data.
2. Library Utilization: Use libraries to interact with TON to retrieve information about wallets and their balances.
3. Development of Analytical Models: Apply data analysis methods, including backtesting, to test hypotheses and analyze assets.
4. Integration of Secondary Solutions: Integrate all solutions into a single application to ensure usability and scalability.
